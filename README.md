First ever repository
Ello Everyone!

I am rather new to this programming game, so excuse any silly errors in my code..
About me; I'm a 25 year old male from Boston, MA named Corey Hocking.
Went to school at Northeastern University for Business and work in technical sales.
Very interested in front end development, specifically javascript and jquery.
Currently using Murach's 3rd edition of Javascript and Jquery as a foundation builder, using notepadd++ and Aptana
Not too well versed in html or css so intentions are to hone skills there before deep dive into JS and Jquery.

Feel free to reach out with any advice and suggestions on how I can improve my programming skills moving forward.

Thanks!

Corey
